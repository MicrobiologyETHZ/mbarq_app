    This app allows exploration of data processed and analyzed with [mBARq tool]({url}). It is currently in beta!

    ## Tabs:

    1. ### 📍 Library Map: 

        - Allows you to visualize the insertions found in your library and provides some basic summary statistics.
        - Requires mapping file generated by `mbarq map` command
    
    ***

    2. ### 📈 Exploratory Analysis: 

        - Generates an interactive PCA plot
        - Generates barcode abundance plots for genes of interest
        - Requires merged count file generated by `mbarq count` and a the same sample data file used for the analysis

    ***
    
    3. ### 📊 Differential Abundance Results

        - Visualize differential abundance results for all genes or specific KEGG pathways
        - Draw heatmaps of log fold changes across the conditions for specific KEGG pathways
        - Requires a `gene summary` files generated by `mbarq analyze` command and a `gmt` file
